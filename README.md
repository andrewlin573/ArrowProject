# ArrowProject

This project was created for an Arrow Electronics Coding Challenge assignment. This application was developed using Angular Javascript and Charting. There are two parts to this application, distinguished by Angular Material tabs. The first part is a text changer, which takes in an input text, color, and font, and displays the resulting text with the given formatting. The second part of the application fetches data from the CDC api, and displays vaccine allocations by state in an Angular Material Table using pagination and filtering, and then graphs the data in a bar chart using ng2-charts.
